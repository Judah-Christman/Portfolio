Personal/Portfolio Website

This repository contains my person/portfolio website used to display my skills in web development and to upload a few of my other projects and hobbies. I created this page using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. This website and some of the apps inside are my first projects to use Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I had primarily used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create websites, but have loved using these newer softwares to develop faster and cleaner web applications.
