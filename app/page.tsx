          Hello! I am a web developer who has been crafting websites for the last 6 years. Most of my experience comes from creating websites for fun as a hobby but have built a few websites for local businesses.
I have built many different websites from simple landing pages advertising businesses to multipage websites managed by an admin dashboard. I specialize in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, developing quick and interactive websites and web apps for all kinds of needs. I have also developed sites that integrate with databases using REST apiâ€™s, or that pull data from online csv sheets. Whether you need a landing page to advertise your business and provide contact information, or an admin console managed webpage that displays your products and/or events, I have you covered. Reach out today and I am sure we can develop something great together!
